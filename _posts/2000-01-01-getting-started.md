Now how to build your own forecast in practice? Read on:

## Make an Inventory of your transactions

Before feeding any data into WiseCash, take a moment to make an inventory of the expenses and income that your business runs on. Useful data about this is can be found in:

* Upcoming payments from your revenue sources (consulting, products etc.).
* Upcoming planned taxes schedule.
* Your last bank receipts (especially useful to detect repeat transactions).
* Our list of [commonly found repeat transactions in a business,Common Business Expenses & Income].

You do not have to chase every little transaction to get an accurate forecast: instead, make sure to think about all medium-to-large upcoming transactions.

## Enter your planned expenses and income

Using [repeat transactions,Setting up a Recurring Transaction] as often as possible (in order to reduce future updating work), enter your planned expenses and income using the entry form.

When in doubt, adopt a **conservative stance**: over-estimate expenses and under-estimate income.

Use the [auto-mark-as-paid,Marking Transactions as Paid] feature to reduce future updating work on your forecast.

  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Focus on the large transactions first. You will get a 95%-accurate forecast in limited time this way. Also, there is not much need to back-fill your past data. Instead, focus on getting upcoming transactions right.

## Forecast your cash-flow

Once the forecast data is ready, you can:

* [Forecast your business bank-account balance, Balance Forecast & Runway Estimation] (up to one year in advance).
* Track and forecast your [yearly income goal,Yearly Income Tracking] (including planned & paid income transactions).
* Visualize a [monthly-breakdown] of profits, expenses and income.
* Zoom into a [specific account,Account Overview] to verify upcoming transactions.
