The monthly breakdown shows you, broken down by month, the total of expenses and income. It also computes the monthly profit (income minus expenses).

This chart helps you realize the **potential lack of balance between upcoming expenses and income**. It may underline the [lack of recurring income](https://www.wisecashhq.com/blog/recurring-revenue-matters-visual-explanation), something that you can improve once you measure it. It also helps you detect difficult months way ahead, so that you can better prepare your business.
