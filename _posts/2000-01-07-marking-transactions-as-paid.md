Once planned transactions have occurred for real and have been materialized on your bank account, you must mark them as paid inside WiseCash to reflect that situation.

<div class='alert alert-info' role='alert'>
  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> This is especially important since some charts (like the burn-chart or the yearly goal income tracker) will display different informations based on the transactions status.
</div>

To mark a transaction as paid, simply check its "mark as paid" checkbox:

{% include animation.html file="mark-transaction-as-paid.gif" %}

If you have small auto-paid transactions such as subscriptions, you can save some clicks by using the "auto-mark as paid on due date" checkbox:

{% include screenshot.html file="auto-mark-as-paid-on-due-date.png" %}
