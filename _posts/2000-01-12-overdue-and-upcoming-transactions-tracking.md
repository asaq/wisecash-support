WiseCash provides you with a short-term dashboard, helpful to review overdue and 2-week upcoming transactions. It helps you **offload cognitive burden from your brain** and focus on what matters to you (outside finances).

To reach the dashboard, simply click on the **Dashboard** {% icon fa-home %} icon:

{% include screenshot.html file="upcoming-and-outstanding-transactions.png" %}

This screen is useful to:

* Quickly review and [mark transactions as paid, Marking transactions as paid].
* Make sure you have invoiced your clients.
* Review which payments you should have received.
* Make sure you anticipate an upcoming payment or filing.
* Make sure you do not have an outstanding cost yet to be paid.

The dashboard acts as a convenient todo list after a long period not managing your finances, such as holidays, an illness or a long streak of work, or even before taking some time off.

When you are offline, you can receive the [same list of transactions via email every Sunday, Getting a Weekly Reminder Email], to make sure you do not miss a tax deadline for instance!
