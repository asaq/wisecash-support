WiseCash helps you modelize repeat transactions (salaries, subscriptions, etc.) without having to labor over a spreadsheet. Here is how to create a repeat transaction in your forecast:

## Go to the Account Overview page

You can create repeat transactions from most pages in WiseCash, yet doing this from the [Account Overview] page makes it easier to verify your data entry:

{% include screenshot.html file="reaching-account-overview.png" %}

## Enter Transaction Information And Create Transaction

In the transaction entry form, define the type of transaction (expense / income), pick a start date, an account and a repeat period, then click on **Create**:

{% include animation.html file="data-entry.gif" %}

You can later modify the repeat transaction in multiple ways:

* [Modifying One Occurrence of a Series].
* [Modifying All Upcoming Occurrences ].
* [Stopping a Recurring Series].

It's also possible to [simulate month-to-month growth, Simulating Month-to-Month Growth].

<div class='alert alert-info' role='alert'>
  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Changing the due date on repeat transactions is not yet possible (but planned). For now the recommended work-around is to delete your series and recreate one.
